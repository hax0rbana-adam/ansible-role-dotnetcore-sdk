# By default, the apt repo will use the correct one for your distro
# However, this can be overridden becuase Microsoft screwed up their repos.
# For example, in the case of Debian 13, only .NET 10.0 is available, despite
# their documentation saying 8, 9, and 10 are all supported. As such, users
# on Debian 13 who want an older version of the sdk will want to set the
# following variable to "12" where all three versions of .NET are available.

# If overriding the major version, you'll also need to override the codename
dotnet_distro_codename: "{{ ansible_distribution_release }}"

# Microsoft also changed their key in the spring of 2025, as described here:
# https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/
# So it's possible we will need to override the filename and checksum if using
# an older repo.
